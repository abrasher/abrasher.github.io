## FAQ

### How much content can I request?
You can request an unlimited amount of TV and Movies now! Use the link above and sign into your Plex account and request whatever you want. The content should be available in less than 10 minutes and will send you an email when it is!

### How long does it take for a new episode / movie to be added?
It depends on usually on the popularity of the show. At worst it takes about an hour after the show has aired, at best it leaks early! I would say and average of 20 minutes after the show has aired!

### How do I always play at max quality?
Quality is set for each video player. You can change it inside the settings for the application.

### What Quality am I allowed to play at?
You can play at any quality! There is usually a quality setting in each Plex that lets you set to original quality!

### Can I download stuff offline to watch on a trip?
Yes you can, however this requires the paid verison of the plex app of choice (Android/ iOS)

### How can I get access to 4K content?
You can ask for access to a 4K TV and Movie Library. They are two separate libraries. There are some requirements though:
1. You can't transcode 4K well if at all. This means you have to play at original quality with a compaitable player. I can help with this.
2. 4K Movies require a good internet connection, at least 100 Mbps for smooth playback.
3. Most 4K content is HDR which requires a device that playback HDR and a display that can play HDR. Without this the colours are washed out and unwatchable.

### How much does the server cost a month?
The server costs me around 46 dollars a month. I am sharing the server with myself and 6 others.
Therefore the monthly cost is around $7 per user.

### Can I invite someone I know?
Sure, the more users we have the less it costs for each person overall!
